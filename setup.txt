Two terminals

Backend:

1.  cd backend    to enter the backend directory
a.  Only run this command once to seed in the initial data     python manage.py seed_data

2.  source venv/bin/activate    to start the virtual environment
3.  run    sudo service postgresql start    to start the database
4.  run    python manage.py runserver   to start the backend server


Frontend:

1. cd frontend to enter the frontend directory
2. run    npm run dev   to start the frontend server



Troubleshooting:

Incase wsl crashes and cannot reconnect, reload the window and connect again, if that fails and is showing some kind of error logs,
 close vscode and open powershell and run it as administrator.

  Type this command:    wsl --shutdown
  and hit enter, then launch vscode again and connect to wsl
